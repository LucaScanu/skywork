#HTML5 Freelance Test
_____________________
=====================

I thoroughly enjoyed the task, which allowed me to discover and experiment with many properties of the Create.JS libraries.
The documentation and the getting started section of the web pages were very helpful in allowing me to build the banner.

However, the final result is not exactly as it should be as I believe some of the pictures were missing from the images folder (Namely the gradient stamp and the button image).

I encountered some problems with the gradient text as I couldn't recreate it the same way I would with CSS. I tried to find a solution through Stackoverflow.com and Google but my searches proved fruitless.  

I also did not manage to apply the white blurred sheen to  the call to action image button.
